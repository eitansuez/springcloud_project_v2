This repository is a version of https://github.com/eitansuez/springcloud_project, with updated Spring dependencies.

- Spring Boot is updated to version 1.5.10
- Spring Cloud Contract is updated to version 1.2.3
- Spring Cloud Release Train is updated to Edgware.SR2
- Spring Cloud Services is updated to v1.6.1.RELEASE

Also, where possible, integration tests take advantage of Spring Boot's support for test slices (e.g. @WebMvcTEst).
See https://spring.io/blog/2016/04/15/testing-improvements-in-spring-boot-1-4[this blog post^] for more information on that.

The main gist of this repository is not as much the end product as it is the history of commits that demonstrate how the end product is arrived at.

The starting point (tag `01-start`) is a simple Spring Boot application.  The application is initially refactored into two separate applications.  Next we add integration tests, and use Wiremock to generate a stub for testing one service in the absence of the other.  The system is progressively enhanced to take advantage of Spring Cloud libraries:

- Contracts
- Hystrix
- Eureka
- Ribbon
- Feign
- Config Server

The last commit updates the projects for deployment to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, using the Spring Cloud Services tile.
